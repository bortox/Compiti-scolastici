We're going to talk about the origins of English culture and literature in this page, right from the beginning. 

The first inhabitants of British Isles vere the Iberians, many centuries B.C.

  We say "B.C." (Before Christ) or "B.C.E" (Before Common/Christian Era) for events happened before the year 0, and instead "A.D." (Anno Domini) or "C.E." (Common Era) while referring to events happened after the year 0.

After the Iberians settled in the Isles (our book - LitHub - doesn't even talk about them!) Celts arrived.

With the arrival of Celts, England became a melting pot of **germanic tribes**, since Celts were Germanic, of whom the two most known were **Britons** and **Gaels**.

## Britons and Gaels

Britons settled in the South-East of England, the most fertile area, while Gaels - not to be confused with Gauls, in southern France - settled in Wales, Ireland and Scotland.

## Celts ahead of their time

The Celtic society was **ahead of its time**. In fact, Celts:

* invented plaugh
* built forthills (fortifications on hills)
* gave same opportunities to both women and men.

## Role of women

Women could own properties and even choose their husband! Usually in germanic tribes men fought, not women, but with Celts we catch an exception: queen **Boudicca** chose a new husband after hers died, and even fought against the Romans.

## Hierarchy of Celtic Society

Since Celts have germanic origins, this society - as the Longobards in Italy - was organised in tribes and families. Each family had a warmongering **leader**, farmers, hunters, and a priest, who worshipped natural elements and held celebrations in the woods, AKA Druid.

## The Druids' importance for culture preservation

The Druid was a priest, and he knew all kinds of things!



He mastered medicine, religion and he was also literate, so he knew how to preserve the tribe's history by writing down it with carved objects -runes- using an alphabet called *Futharc*.
