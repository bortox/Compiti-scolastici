description: "The Anglo Saxon Society in England after the invasion. Values, Hierarchy and poetry production. "
---

The Anglo Saxon society had a hierarchical structure. 
Since Anglo Saxons were Germans, the Germanic values were held in great consideration:

* loyalty
* physical courage (to fight)
* personal freedom
* bravery


## The King

The king, at the top of the society, had its own group of warriors, the *thanes*, bound by loyalty to him - the most important value. King and thanes togheter form the *comitatus*.

Usually the king also created a **mid-hall**, like the one we've seen in Beowulf, which is a large room in the castle, where people joined to celebrate victory and to drink. The main hobbies of Germanic people, were, in fact, feasting and drinking.

The most common jobs were artisans, farmers and warriors.

## The Scop

The word *scop* comes from the word shape, which is derived from the Old English verb *shippam* "To Create", since the Scop **manufactured stories** like an artisan creates shapes. 


He had to tell folks in the mid-hall, traditional stories, orally, since the major slice of the population was illiterate.

He was also **present in battle**s, as a commentator and an observer, this way scops managed to record centuries of Old English language, common life and heroic acts. 

The Scop didn't just tell stories, he also **played musical instruments**, usually a harp to make the stories easier to recall for the illiterate listeners.
 
This is how epic poems, such as the Beowulf, survived through centuries, without being written. We find a similar case with the Iliad and the Odyssey, heritages from the Greek oral tradition too. 

The Scop had **vocal conscience**: he was **telling** history, but also **collecting** history.
