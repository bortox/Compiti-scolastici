## <font color="red">Who</font> discovered dinosaurs?
#### The first detections of dinosaur fossils.

**Mary Anning** was a researcher who spent her life finding bones of big animals in **Lyme Regis**.

The best way to **find fossils** for Mary was by climbing over a cliff and searching for strange rocks after storms. 

It was early 1800s. The name _dinosaur_ didn't exist yet.

She found some _Ichthyosaurs_ and a _Pterosaur_. 

Her discoveries **attracted scientist**, who visited her:

- **William Buckland**, a clever and strange scientist, discovered a Megalosaurus and talk about that with Mary. 

- **Gideon Mantell**, a doctor in Lewes, found a Iguanodon and a Hyleosaurus, and visited mary. 

**Richard Owen**, another scientist, wrote the book _Dinosauria_ about the recent discoveries of the past and he was the one who had given the name _dinosaurs_ to these strange animals of the past and he classified dinosaurs in three big groups that are **still used today**:

Marsh and Cope competed to find more bones than each other, they often argued on newspapers and books, this made dinosaur hunting very popular. Cope found 56 types of dinosaur, while Marsh - winning the bone wars - discovered 80 types of dinosaur.
