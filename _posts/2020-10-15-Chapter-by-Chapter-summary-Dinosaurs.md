## Chapter 1

Mary Anning was a researcher that spent her life finding dinosaurs bones in Lyme Regis.

The best way to find dinosaur fossils for Mary was by climbing over a cliff and searching for strange rocks after storms. 

It was early 1800s. The name _dinosaur_ didn't exist yet.

She found some _Ichthyosaurs_ and a _Pterosaur_. 

Her discoveries attracted scientist, who visited her:

- William Buckland, a clever and strange scientist, discovered a Megalosaurus and talk about that with Mary. 

- Gideon Mantell, a doctor in Lewes, found a Iguanodon and a Hyleosaurus, and visited mary. 

**Richard Owen**, another scientist, wrote the book _Dinosauria_ about the recent discoveries of the past and he was the one who had given the name _dinosaurs_ to these strange animals of the past and he classified dinosaurs in three big groups that are **used still today**:

|GROUP|DINOSAUR|ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Theropods|Megalosaurus|Meat-eating, had small hands; relatively small ( a few  meters [1-4] height )
Sauropods|Iguanodon|Long neck, vegetarian and quite big ( 5-30m height ). Catched food and attacked the predators with their hands.
