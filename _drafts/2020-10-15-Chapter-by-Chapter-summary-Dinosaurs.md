## <font color="red">Who</font> discovered dinosaurs?
#### The first detections of dinosaur fossils.

**Mary Anning** was a researcher who spent her life finding bones of big animals in **Lyme Regis**.

The best way to **find fossils** for Mary was by climbing over a cliff and searching for strange rocks after storms. 

It was early 1800s. The name _dinosaur_ didn't exist yet.

She found some _Ichthyosaurs_ and a _Pterosaur_. 

Her discoveries **attracted scientist**, who visited her:

- **William Buckland**, a clever and strange scientist, discovered a Megalosaurus and talk about that with Mary. 

- **Gideon Mantell**, a doctor in Lewes, found a Iguanodon and a Hyleosaurus, and visited mary. 

**Richard Owen**, another scientist, wrote the book _Dinosauria_ about the recent discoveries of the past and he was the one who had given the name _dinosaurs_ to these strange animals of the past and he classified dinosaurs in three big groups that are **still used today**:

|GROUP|DINOSAUR|ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
|---|---|---|
Theropods|Megalosaurus|Meat-eating, had small hands; relatively small ( a few  meters [1-4] length )
Sauropods|Iguanodon|Long neck, vegetarian and quite big ( 5-30m length ). Catched food and attacked the predators with their hands.
Ornithiscians|Hylaeosaurus|Claw on their tail and thick skin to defend themselves against predators. Vegetarian with short neck.

> Owen had told scientists about dinosaurs and the division of them into groups in London, 1853. He had also written a book about it. The book was read all over the world. Soon scientists and  and, in the 1870, two Americans - Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope - began to find dinosaurs in North America

Marsh and Cope competed to find more bones than each other, they often argued on newspapers and books, this made dinosaur hunting very popular. 

Cope found 56 types of dinosaur, while Marsh - winning the bone wars - discovered 80 types of dinosaur.

![Timeline of dinosaurs]({{ "/data/img/inglese/dinosaurs-timeline.webp" | absolute_url }})


The first dinosaurs appeared about 250 millions of years ago, and were like small chickens.

That's because they were the survivors from a mass extinction of 95% of dinosaurs.

They lived in Pangaea, a large continent in Earth.

The first dinosaurs are called _archosaurs_. _Eoraptor_ is one of them, for example, 30cm high and 1 metre long, like a dog who runs fast.

From _archosaurs_ dinosaurs evolved in three main groups, descripted by Richard Owen. 

The first group is made of meat-eating dinosaurs, like Tyrannosaurus Rex, who are small, fast and hunt in groups. Theu are called _Theropods_. Theropods also have strong teeths and long tails.

The second group is made of vegetarian dinosaurs, which are very big  - up to 40 metres long. The biggest ones need to eat two or three trees a day! It was very hard for predators to kill them, so Theropods managed to kill the oldest ones in groups.

The third group, who was the last one that evolved, it's made of vegetarian dinosaurs medium sized, who had a claw to defend them and a very thick skin, to resist from predators. They are called _ornithrisciants_. _Protocerapots_ was one of them.
